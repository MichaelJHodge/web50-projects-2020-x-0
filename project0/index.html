      <h3>Artisan Bread</h3>
        <p>This recipe is a great recipe for those who've never 
        made homemade bread before. Requiring only 4 ingredients, this recipe 
        is perfect for those looking to learn more about bread making
        and yeast! While you could follow the no-knead method, learning
        and becoming comfortable with kneading and shaping dough will
        allow you to bake some of the best loaves you've ever tasted, and
        it will all be done by your own two hands.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>420g bread flour (3 1/4 cups)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons course salt </li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (360ml)luke warm water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> In your large/deep mixing bowl, mix together the flour,
                yeast, salt, and water. Feel free to use a wooden spoon or
                even better, your hands! Don't worry if the dough is sticky,
                this is totally normal. Once all the ingredients all well
                combined and incorporated, shape into a ball as best as you can. 
            </li>
            <li>Cover well with a tea towel, apron, etc., for 2-3 hours at 
                room temperature. The dough should almost double in size. </li>
            <li> Now, after this step, you could skip right to the baking part, 
                no-knead required! However, for absolute best flavor, I highly suggest
                kneading your bread dough periodically (once or twice every hour until 
                bake time should suffice). For an easy tutorial on kneading,
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySOj0fFWo1U">Click here </a>
            </li>
            <li> Roughly 1 whole hour before baking your bread, pre-heat your oven
                to 475 degrees F. Whichever tool you choose to bake your bead (I highly
                suggest a dutch-oven), don't forget to put that in the oven so it can heat up
                as well. During this time, shape your dough once more, and place it
                into your lightly-floured wooden banneton. Loosely cover until the 1 hour has passed.

            </li>
            <li> When this hour has passed, gently turn your banneton over
                onto a lightly-floured piece of parchment paper. Using your bread lame,
                razor, or scissors, score your dough with 3-4 slashes across the top, about 1/2 in deep. 
                Once you become more confident, you can find more intricate scoring patterns online!
            </li>
            <li> Now, carefully remove your dutch-oven or oven-safe pot with cover, and gently 
                place your dough (on the parchment) into the pot, and cover. Bake for 25 minutes
                at 475 degrees F, and then remove the lid and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li> Remove the bread from the oven and tap the bottom of the loaf carefully, if it sounds
                hollow, then the bread is done! If not, put it back in the oven, directly on the rack,
                for an additional few minutes. 
             </li>
            <li> Let cool for at least 30-40 minutes before slicing and enjoying! </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Tips and Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <b> Flour:</b> I personally recommend using a combination of white (70%), wheat (20%), and rye (10%) flour.
                The bread will be slightly more dense and packing with more flavor!
            </li>
            <li><b>Yeast:</b> If using instant yeast, you can mix the ingredients together, no problem!
            If using active dry yeast, you'll need to combine the water and yeast beforehand for a couple of minutes
        before adding other ingredients. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Dutch oven:</b> I highly suggest using a dutch oven, as they can not only withstand
            warmer oven temperatures, but the lid will allow for a nice crust to form. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Water:</b> It's better to use water that isn't too cold or too hot. If it's too cold, it will slow
            down the yeast development. Too hot and you could damage or kill your yeast.  
            </li>
