# web50-projects-2020-x-0

Hello all! This is Project 0 for CS50s Web Programming w/JS and Python course.

My website/app is basically just a tutorial on how to make homemade, artisan bread. I've put
the majority of my focus and work into the landing page, but also created about me, recipes, and contact pages that I will be putting further work into as I build more skills throughout the course.
